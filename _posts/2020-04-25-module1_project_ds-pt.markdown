We just finished our Module 1 Project in DS-PT. What I've learned from the Module 1 project other than coding was how efficient it is to work with a team. We kept each other motivated as we helped one another.

I found the project much more helpful in my learning process than the labs. When our instructor gave us access to finished projects from the previous cohort, I was very impressed with the complete jupyter notebooks on github. When I saw the results from the previous cohort, I felt overwhelmed and uncertain about achieving similar results. I was so impressed and jealous that it woke my competitive drive to be better. Coming to an end, I won't say my project itself came out better than the ones I've seen but I got to a point where the previous projects didn't seem as impressive anymore. Thanks to the group motivation and support, I am happy with the results of my project. 

This is how I want to feel and how I want my teammates to feel: overwhelmed by the success of the works and efforts of the previous cohort and to eventually feel unimpressed towards the end because with effort, we can do it too.
