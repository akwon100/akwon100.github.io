If I could give advice to myself back in march (my first day at flatiron) I would tell myself to make more time available. At the beginning of the program I had quite a bit of time, then I got a job which made it much harder for me to focus on the bootcamp, towards the end the lack of time made things less enjoyable. I regret that I didn't spend as much time as I would like to for the last projects. If it is an option, I would advise future students to take the bootcamp full time (of course I realize this isn't an option for a lot of people). Other than that, the bootcamp is enjoyable and supportive.
