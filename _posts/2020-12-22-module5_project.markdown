For my Module 5 project I have chosen to classify images of simpson characters. A Kaggle user has accumulated and organized images for each character and made the project much more easier than for me to collect images on my own. 
After the project if I collect more images I can use my model to classify characters and gather more photos... if I wanted a photo collection of different characters. I can see how this may be useful if I wanted to collect photos online of different cities or flowers. This was a very fun project.
