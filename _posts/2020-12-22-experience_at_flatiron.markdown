I am on my (hopefully) last weeks at flatiron. I learned a lot and I think there is still so much to learn. I've learned about different models of machine learning. I've also learned the importance of teamwork. My cohort has kept me motivated and the support that each student gives to each other made me realize how work can be facilitaed through teamwork. Being somewhat of a loner I didn't realize that working in a team would be this fun. For any future students I would suggest getting to know your cohort members and holding study groups.
