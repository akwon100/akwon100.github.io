The third module project required us to choose data and I chose data on heart disease. 
Our assignment was to use different machine learning models and compare models. 
I used different models to predict wether a patient, given certain symptoms (features). Some of the models I was able to write from scratch which was a fun experience... they are clearly not as fast as existing libraries such as sklearn but through it I was able to learn more precisely how each model works.
