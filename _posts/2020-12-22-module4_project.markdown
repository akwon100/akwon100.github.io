For our fourth module project I chose to work on Time Series. Unfortunately, Ive made the mistake of using poor data. I've used data on COVID found on Kaggle, a data which recorded covid cases and deaths and recoveries globally but over the span of 3 months. Since covid is a virus, three months is not enough time to show any patterns over time, I would suspect that if data was taken over years then one can make a better time series model. Overall, the project was still enjoyable and I learned how more about how to approach studying data.
